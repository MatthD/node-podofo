# Bindings for the PoDoFo PDF Library

This project provides NodeJS bindings for the [PoDoFo](http://podofo.sourceforge.net/)
PDF library.

Basic functionality has been implemented, but this is generally a work in
progress. Pull requests are welcome.

## Installing

This requires `libpodofo` to be installed. If you are using Ubuntu, the
following command should suffice:

    sudo apt-get install libpodofo-dev

Then, installing this library is as simple as:

    npm install podofo
